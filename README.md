# File-transfer-using-RMI

In todayâ€™s world the use of middleware in inter-system communication has become very
prevalent. For distributed applications, communication between two different applications is
frequent and imperative.


Remote Method Invocation (RMI) is an API provided by java which allows one object residing
in one JVM (Java Virtual Machine) invokes objects running on the JVM of the same machine or
a remote machine.Thus, without using any other external communication mechanism Java
applications communicate with each other directly in real-time and in a secured manner.


At the client side, the system will be able to upload files to the server or download files via the
server, explore files/directories or even create or delete files/directories. For all these functions
the system provides an interface containing method signatures and an implementation file for
execution of these functions. The system uses the JAVA I/O stream class objects to execute these
methods.
